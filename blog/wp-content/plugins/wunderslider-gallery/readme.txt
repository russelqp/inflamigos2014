WunderSlider Gallery turns default WordPress and NextGEN galleries into responsive fullscreen and embedded WunderSlider slideshows.

== Description ==

This plugin provides an automated way to convert any standard WordPress gallery that is embedded on a page using the [gallery] shortcode into a *WunderSlider*.

WunderSlider Gallery also supports [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) to embed any gallery as a *WunderSlider* using the [wunderslider_nggallery] shortcode or by enabling it as the default renderer for the [nggallery] shortcode. 

The plugin requires the *WunderSlider* which is available freely for personal use and can be downloaded on the [WunderSlider](http://www.itthinx.com/wunderslider/) page.

A license is required to be purchased for commercial use, see the WunderSlider page for more details.

__Usage / Notes on settings__

After you have followed the instructions on installing *WunderSlider* and the *WunderSlider Gallery* plugin, go to __Appearance > WunderSlider Gallery__ and have a look at the default settings.

 `[gallery]` shortcode attributes :

- The `size` attribute uses `full` by default. Set it to another size if you don't need the full image size.

  Default sizes are `thumbnail`, `medium`, `large` and `full`.

- WunderSlider attributes that use a dash in the attribute name must be used with an underscore instead when passed to the `[gallery]` shortcode. If used, `container-class`, `container-style`, `container-height` and `container-width` must be passed as `container_class`, `container_style`, `container_height` and `container_width` to the `[gallery]` shortcode.
  This is especially important when the `display="proportional"` setting is used, as you will have to provide the container width and height explicitly.
  
  Example:
  
  `[gallery display="proportional" container_width="80%" container_height="360px"]` 

- If you do *not* want the WunderSlider applied to a specific gallery, you must add the `wunderslider="false"` attribute, for example:
 
  `[gallery wunderslider="false"]`
  
__Usage with [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/)__

Any NextGEN gallery can be rendered as a *WunderSlider* using the `[wunderslider_nggallery]` shortcode or by enabling defaults for NextGEN Gallery shortcodes in the __Appearance > WunderSlider Gallery__ settings. 

Example: 

  `[wunderslider_nggallery id="123"]` will render a WunderSlider for the NextGEN gallery with id 123.

The [nggallery] shortcode can be rendered as a WunderSlider by either enabling it by default or by specifying:

`[nggallery id="123" wunderslider="true"]`

For this to take effect, the option to handle NextGEN Gallery shortcodes must be enabled on the settings page __Appearance > WunderSlider Gallery__.

As with the `[gallery]` shortcode, any WunderSlider attributes can be passed to `[wunderslider_nggallery]` or `[nggallery]` - those that use a dash in the attribute name must be used with an underscore instead: `container-class`, `container-style`, `container-height` and `container-width` must be passed as `container_class`, `container_style`, `container_height` and `container_width`.

Examples:

- `[wunderslider_nggallery id="1" container_width="80%" container_height="300px" display="proportional"]`
- `[nggallery id="1" wunderslider="true" container_width="80%" container_height="300px" display="proportional"]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the purpose of this plugin? =

This plugin provides an automated way to convert any standard WordPress gallery that is embedded on a page using the [gallery] shortcode into a WunderSlider.

This plugin requires the [WunderSlider](http://www.itthinx.com/wunderslider/) - either a free personal or a licensed commercial copy.

Installing this plugin without the [WunderSlider](http://www.itthinx.com/wunderslider/) is a bit pointless, so get yourself a copy and follow the installation instructions.

= Where can I see a demo? =

- [WunderSlider Demo](http://www.wunderslider.com/)
- [WunderSlider WordPress Demo](http://wunderslider.com/wordpress/)

= What's the difference between the free personal version and the licensed commercial version? =

In features, there is *no* difference at all.

The main difference is that you are not allowed to use the free version for commercial purposes.

Please refer to [WunderSlider](http://www.itthinx.com/wunderslider/) for details on that.

By default, the free personal version will place a small icon on pages where it is used and send usage data, if you don't want that, you can turn these off on the Appearance > WunderSlider Gallery settings page in the admin section.
